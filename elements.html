<h1 class="prototype">About</h1>
        
<p class="ewdescription">Website sharing information on five elements that I have chosen which are Helium, Hydrogen, Lithium, Boron and Oxygen. The website is aimed at students so I chose to include both detailed explanations and visual elements such as video.</p>
        
<p class="ewdescription">I chose to include video examples of each element as I think that it is always easier to remember something when you can see a visual image of it.</p>
        
<h1 class="prototype">Animations</h1>
        
<p class="ewdescription">I included some animations as-well such as the homepage which has an animated introductory video created in After Effects and I also included animated 'atoms' for each element to give it a bit more visual appeal.</p>
        
<p class="ewdescription">I think the key part of the website that makes it stand out is the video portion of website, I will detail below how I created them</p>

<h1 class="prototype">Photograph to Video</h1>
        
<p class="ewdescription">Technically they are and are not videoâ€™s as I created them using photographs from which I cut out a rocket from a photo which created two separate images for me to animate in After Effects, the rocket and the background.</p>

<h1 class="prototype">After Effects</h1>
        
<p class="ewdescription">I created the animation by making both images 3D Layers so that I could change the perspective a little allowing it to appear more like video, plus it also gave it the whole scene a little for depth. 

First I animated the position of the rocket using keyframes and dragged it so that it slowly went upward, I then adjusting the angle of the 3D Camera and the rotation manoeuvred the 3D Camera a bit so that it gave the rocket a bit of a rotation.
