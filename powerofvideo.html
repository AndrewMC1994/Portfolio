<h1 class="prototype">About</h1>
        
<p class="povdescription">The Power of Video was a video conference that I created the logo and mascot for, I also created some additonal items such as posters and banners.</p>
        
<p class="povdescription">It is a conference that will focus on the power of video in terms of how content creators on platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat or Beme have become a major influence, both online and offline and how they have turned their passions into full-time careers.</p>
        
<h1 class="prototype">Prototyping</h1>
        
<p class="povdescription">I wasn't really given a brief for this project, I was simply told to create a logo that had some form of play button and as you can see below I went through quite a few! haha.</p>
        
<p class="povdescription">My idea developed from trying to create something that resembled a normal play button that you would see on a YouTube video or any video for that matter to attempting to create something I appeared more handdrawn as the event was about content creaters and their creations so I wanted it to look handmade</p>

<h1 class="prototype">Final Logo</h1>
        
<p class="povdescription">Finally "Damien" who overlooked the project liked the design shown below and luckily so did I, it covered all the requirements of the event and met what I intended the design to look like which was 1. to include a play button and 2. to have a handdrawn appearance.</p>

<h1 class="prototype">Mascot</h1>
        
<p class="povdescription">I wasn't originally tasked with creating a mascot, I created a basic sketch as a example to begin with just as a sort of extra with the logo but "Damien" really liked the idea so we ran with it. Below you can see the final design. A female version was also created but was not used.</p>
